# kv-downloader

[![CI](https://github.com/subdigital/kv-downloader/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/subdigital/kv-downloader/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a small utility that automates a workflow for downloading individual tracks from Karaoke Version.

This workflow is specific to how I use this service. If you want to change it you're welcome to fork this
repo and make your own changes. I _may_ accept pull requests if the changes are useful and general enough.

## What it does

This app will drive a headless (or visible) Chromium browser that will log into your account, navigate to
a song page. It will solo & download each individual track separately.

The browser portion of this app will auto-download upon first use.

## Why?

I like to set up my own mix for backing tracks using Logic. For maximum flexibility I want each track downloaded separately.

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, Windows
- Karaoke Version account with purchased songs
- Chromium (will be downloaded automatically)

## Installation & Set Up

Look at the Releases pageâ€™s assets for the latest version of the app. Download the appropriate version for your platform,
uncompress it, and put it somewhere in your PATH.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note for macOS: Gatekeeper may block the app from running. In order to run this, navigate to Privacy & Security in System Preferences, and click the "Open Anyway" button.

Run `kv_downloader auth` to provide your credentials. You only need to do this once.

> [!NOTE]
> Your credentials are stored securely by your operating system's keychain. They are not sent anywhere _except_ to the Karaoke Version website.

## Usage

First, you have to purchase the track in your Karaoke Version account. Copy the URL of the song you want.

Then run `kv_downloader download <song url>`. You can also pass options to customize the behavior:

## Options

- `-d <path>` - Change the download location
-  `-h` or `--headless` - Use headless mode, which hides the UI.
-  `-t <transpose offset>` - Change the pitch of the downloaded tracks (-1 to go down half step, 1 to go up half step, etc)
- `--count-in` - Include the intro precount on all tracks
- `--debug` - Enable debug logging (in case something goes wrong this helps give more detail)

Using headless mode may make it less clear what is going on behind the scenes, so I suggest testing it out
in the regular mode first.


## Build and Run from Source

- Ensure you have a [working rust development setup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Clone or download the zip file of the source code
- cd into the project and type `cargo build`
- Add a `.env` file in the root of the project and include:

```
KV_USERNAME=<yourusername>
KV_PASSWORD=<yourpassword>
```

- type `cargo run -- --help` (note the double dashes to separate the args from the cargo command)

Usage is the same as above, except you'll be typing `cargo run --` instead of `kv_downloader`.

For example:

```
cargo run -- download <song url> -d my_song_dir --count-in
```

## Use at your own risk

This tool is simply to automate a process that you would do normally. I do not recommend using this
in huge batches or concurrently, as this may well be against their terms, so use at your own risk.

I would hate for anyone's account to get banned for abusing automation like this.

And Karaoke Version, if you're listening: We'd love if this was fully supported in the UI!
